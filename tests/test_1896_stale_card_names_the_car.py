"""A warning you cannot act on is a warning that gets dismissed.

@starwarsfan (#1896) runs an Audi Q4 e-tron and a Škoda on one setup and got:

    ***022149: Fahrzeugdaten seit 216 h nicht mehr aktualisiert

Two separate faults in one card.

**It does not say which car.** The title carried the masked VIN alone, which is
recognisable only to someone who has gone and looked it up. He has two cars; the
warning told him something was wrong without telling him what. The card now
names the vehicle the way the device page does — through the *same* helper, so
the two cannot drift apart — and falls back to the masked VIN when there is no
label, which is exactly what it did before.

**And it told him to open volkswagen.de.** He has an Audi and a Škoda. That
instruction was wrong twice over: wrong site for a non-Volkswagen owner, and
wrong place even for a Volkswagen, because a lapsed EU Data Act feed is fixed in
the portal and not on volkswagen.de. His own words are the reason this matters
more than a typo would: *"I don't want to touch the setup for that car, which is
already working!"* — a card that misdirects is a card that gets people to break
something that works.

The description also asserted the EU Data Act as one of exactly two causes. This
repair fires for **any** car whose capture stamp has aged past the threshold,
including one read over a brand channel, where that cause cannot apply at all.
The opener is source-neutral now and two conditional paragraphs say what to do
in each case.
