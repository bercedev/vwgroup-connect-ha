"""#1834 — a poll that outlived its session was filed as a crash.

The portal connector does not own its HTTP session. The coordinator creates it
with ``async_create_clientsession(self.hass)`` and the comment there states the
consequence plainly: unloading the entry closes it, and there is nothing to
unwind by hand. So any poll still in flight when the user reloads the
integration — or when Home Assistant shuts down — arrives at a session aiohttp
has already closed, and aiohttp answers with a bare
``RuntimeError("Session is closed")``.

Nothing caught it. The retry handler in ``_get_json`` takes ``TimeoutError``
and ``ClientConnectionError``; a ``RuntimeError`` is neither, so it travelled
up to the coordinator and into the error reporter, where a shutdown race was
filed as a crash on a released version.

Two things are asserted here, and the second is the one that matters more than
the exception type: a closed session is **not retried**. Retrying is the one
response that cannot possibly help — the session will not reopen — and the
retry loop would spend its full backoff ladder discovering that, three sleeps
deep, during a shutdown.

On the parent commit the soft case raises ``RuntimeError`` and the "no request
was attempted" assertions fail, because the guard does not exist yet.

Deliberately NOT ``UpstreamUnavailableError``, which was already imported and
would have been the cheap move: its message tells the user this is a
"server-side issue at VW" and that they should not reconfigure. Our own session
going away locally is not that, and an explanation that names the wrong cause
is worse than a plain one. ``test_the_message_does_not_blame_vw`` pins that.
