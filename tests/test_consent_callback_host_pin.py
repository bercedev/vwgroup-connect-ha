"""The consent-skip callback is a request target named by a remote party.

Both consent-skip methods — the IDK one and the EU Data Act port of it — read
``callback=`` out of the URL of the page they landed on and then FETCH it with
the client's own headers. Nothing checked where it pointed. ``urljoin`` returns
an absolute URL unchanged, so a ``callback=https://elsewhere/`` on a consent
page turned into a request issued from the owner's Home Assistant to a host of
someone else's choosing.

This is not a hypothetical shape to worry about in the abstract: both reference
implementations the portal operator points maintainers at validate that target,
and the ioBroker one added exactly this validation on 2026-10-08.

**The refusal is deliberately generous, because the likelier harm is a false
refusal.** Rejecting a legitimate callback ends the login in
``MarketingConsentError``, and that is certain where a diversion is
hypothetical. Three targets are accepted: the host that served the consent page
(which is what every relative callback resolves to, and what the brand IDPs
are), ``vwgroup.io`` with its subdomains, and the portal's own host.

The same file carried two more guards of this class on the cookie path, written
as ``"vwgroup.io" not in domain``. A substring test admits
``vwgroup.io.attacker.com`` and ``evil-vwgroup.io``; the import side would have
restored such a cookie into the jar and then sent it to that host. The correct
form was already documented a few hundred lines away in another module (#632) —
these two copies had been left behind.
