"""The Volkswagen Departure times list and a timer's "Set time" page.

The list (overview → Departure times) shows the climate timers in id order,
each as a clickable row with its clock text and an on/off switch. Tapping the
switch sends at once (APK 4.3.2 ``DepartureTimerViewModel.onSwitchClicked``:
optimistic flip, request, flip back on failure). Tapping the row opens the
timer's page (``fragment_edit_departure_timer``, unchanged ids on 4.6.4):

- ``time_picker``: Android's spinner TimePicker. Each wheel is a NumberPicker
  whose current value is the ``numberpicker_input`` EditText, with the
  previous value drawn as a Button above it and the next one below. A tap on
  either Button moves the wheel one step, which is how the picker is set here:
  one step at a time, each read back. Minutes come in the app's 5-minute steps.
- ``cta_monday`` … ``cta_sunday``: the days, on when ``selected``.
- ``cta_repeat``: the Repeat switch. Off makes a one-time timer on its one day.

Nothing on the page sends until the toolbar's Save (``common_button_save``),
shown in place of the title only while something differs from the saved
timer, beside Cancel (``common_button_cancel``), which restores it. A
successful save goes back to the list (``EditDepartureTimerViewModel``).
Language independent: ids, digits and the picker's own layout only; Save and
Cancel come from the installed app's translations.

The 4.8.1 Compose editor (``editDepartureTimerWeekday`` / ``…Repeat``) hides
its time picker with ``hideFromAccessibility()``, and its day buttons
(``cta_MONDAY`` …) expose no selected state. ``uiautomator dump`` skips the
hidden picker; Compose still exports it, so the a11y helper (``a11y/``) reads
its wheels: one range node each (hour, minute, AM/PM on a 12-hour phone) with
the shown value as state description and SET_PROGRESS as the way to set it.
``read_compose_clock`` parses that output by structure, not by label, so it
does not depend on the app's language. The days come from the list's
recurrence label and cannot be checked on the page, so they are never changed
there; only Repeat is observable on the page itself, so a TimerPage is never
built for this editor.
